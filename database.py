"""A database encapsulating collections of near-Earth objects and their close approaches.

A `NEODatabase` holds an interconnected data set of NEOs and close approaches.
It provides methods to fetch an NEO by primary designation or by name, as well
as a method to query the set of close approaches that match a collection of
user-specified criteria.

Under normal circumstances, the main module creates one NEODatabase from the
data on NEOs and close approaches extracted by `extract.load_neos` and
`extract.load_approaches`.
